# Credit Card Fraud Detection Model
The world is shifting rapidly to the digital space, making online transactions a fundamental part of our daily lives. More people than ever before rely on credit cards for payments, whether it's for shopping, bill payments, subscriptions, or even everyday essentials. Credit card fraud has become one of the most prevalent financial crimes, costing businesses and consumers billions of dollars annually.

Our project focuses on building a machine learning-based credit card fraud detection system that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false alarms. Using advanced classification models, data balancing techniques (SMOTE), and anomaly detection, we aim to detect fraud in real-time, improve detection rates, and reduce financial losses. By leveraging machine learning, statistical analysis, and data-driven techniques, our system will help financial institutions and businesses create safer and more secure digital payment systems. Fraudsters are getting smarter, and itâ€™s time our fraud detection methods do too.
